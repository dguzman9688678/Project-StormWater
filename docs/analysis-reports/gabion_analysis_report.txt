COMPREHENSIVE GABION BASKET ANALYSIS REPORT
==========================================
Project: Road Support Structure
Date: June 28, 2025
Client Request: Gabion basket for new road side support

SITE SPECIFICATIONS
===================
- Length: 16 feet
- Width: 10 feet  
- Depth: 6 feet
- Total Volume: 960 cubic feet
- Application: Road side support/retaining structure

PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING ANALYSIS
=================================

1. STRUCTURAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
- Gabion basket sizing appears appropriate for road support application
- 6-foot depth provides adequate bearing capacity for typical road loads
- 16' x 10' footprint distributes load effectively

2. MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS NEEDED
- Wire mesh: Minimum 3.9mm (12 gauge) galvanized steel wire
- Mesh opening: 80mm x 100mm (3" x 4") hexagonal mesh
- Fill material: Well-graded rock, 4" to 8" diameter stones
- Stone gradation: ASTM D448 Size No. 3 or 4

3. STORMWATER CONSIDERATIONS
- Gabion baskets provide excellent drainage
- Recommend geotextile fabric backing to prevent soil migration
- Consider French drain behind structure for enhanced drainage
- Ensure proper surface drainage to prevent erosion

4. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
- Excavate to firm, undisturbed soil
- Minimum 6" compacted stone base
- Level and square installation critical
- Connect adjacent baskets with tying wire

5. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE ITEMS
- Check local building codes for retaining wall requirements
- May require structural engineer stamp for heights over 4 feet
- Verify setback requirements from road right-of-way
- Consider environmental permits if near waterways

COST CONSIDERATIONS
==================
Note: Provide actual quotes from suppliers for authentic pricing

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============
1. Obtain geotechnical analysis for bearing capacity verification
2. Design proper drainage system behind gabion wall
3. Use high-quality galvanized wire for longevity
4. Consider professional installation for structural integrity
5. Plan for regular inspection and maintenance schedule

This analysis is based on standard engineering practices. Recommend consultation with local structural engineer for final design verification.
