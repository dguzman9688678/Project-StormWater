# Stormwater AI

## Overview

This is a comprehensive AI-powered stormwater solution system that automatically generates professional documents based on uploaded problem scenarios. When users upload any problem document (e.g., "collapsing culvert"), the system analyzes the entire document library and auto-generates relevant solution documents including inspection forms, Job Safety Analyses (JSAs), maintenance plans, monitoring protocols, and compliance checklists - all with proper citations from the source library. The system transforms simple problem descriptions into complete actionable solution packages for professional stormwater management.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite for build tooling
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/UI components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Component Architecture**: Modular component structure with shared UI components

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations (DatabaseStorage for permanent persistence)
- **File Processing**: Comprehensive format support (PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT, XLSX, XLS, CSV, JSON, XML, RTF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, WEBP, HTML, HTM, MD, LOG)
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude integration for document analysis
- **API Design**: RESTful API with proper error handling and validation

### Database Schema

## Data Flow

1. **Document Upload**: Users upload engineering documents through drag-and-drop interface
2. **Content Extraction**: Backend processes files and extracts text content
3. **AI Analysis**: Anthropic Claude analyzes content and generates engineering recommendations
4. **Storage**: Documents, analyses, and recommendations stored in PostgreSQL
5. **Presentation**: Frontend displays organized results with search and filtering capabilities

## External Dependencies

### Required Services
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Primary data storage (configured via DATABASE_URL)
- **Anthropic API**: For AI-powered document analysis (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY required)

### Optional Integrations

### Development Tools
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL provider (via @neondatabase/serverless)
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migrations and schema management
- **ESBuild**: Production builds for server-side code

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- Frontend: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
- Backend: ESBuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
- Database: Drizzle migrations applied via `db:push` command

### Environment Configuration
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment setting (development/production)
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Anthropic API access (required for AI features)
- File upload limits and allowed types configurable

### Production Considerations
- Server configured for node platform with external packages
- Static file serving from built frontend
- Graceful error handling and logging
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
