Stormwater AI

Overview

This is a comprehensive AI-powered stormwater solution system that automatically generates professional documents based on uploaded problem scenarios. When users upload any problem document (e.g., "collapsing culvert"), the system analyzes the entire document library and auto-generates relevant solution documents including inspection forms, Job Safety Analyses (JSAs), maintenance plans, monitoring protocols, and compliance checklists - all with proper citations from the source library. The system transforms simple problem descriptions into complete actionable solution packages for professional stormwater management.

System Architecture

Frontend Architecture

Framework: React with TypeScript using Vite for build tooling
UI Library: Shadcn/UI components built on Radix UI primitives
Styling: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
State Management: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
Routing: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
Component Architecture: Modular component structure with shared UI components
Backend Architecture

Framework: Express.js with TypeScript
Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
File Processing: Multi-format document processing (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
AI Integration: OpenAI GPT-4 integration for document analysis
API Design: RESTful API with proper error handling and validation
Database Schema

Documents: Stores uploaded files with metadata and extracted content
Recommendations: AI-generated and template recommendations categorized by type
AI Analyses: Stores analysis results with insights and queries
Categories: QSD, SWPPP, Erosion Control with subcategories

Changelog

June 28, 2025. Initial setup
User Preferences

Communication Style: Simple, everyday language
Project Ownership: All intellectual property belongs to Daniel Guzman (guzman.danield@outlook.com)
Application Purpose: Personal stormwater support tool providing practical developer, SWPPP, and erosion control recommendations
Focus: Actual support for stormwater work, not projects or user management
Integration Goal: Dashboard that provides comprehensive recommendations from uploaded reference documents
Recent Development Progress

June 28, 2025: Transformed into comprehensive smart solution generation system:
Complete Workflow Redesign: Upload problem document → AI analyzes entire library → Auto-generates solution documents
Smart Document Generation: Auto-creates inspection forms, JSAs, maintenance plans, monitoring protocols based on problem type
Comprehensive Analysis: System references ALL uploaded documents simultaneously for unified solutions
Citation Integration: All generated documents include proper citations from source library
Updated Interface: Renamed sections to reflect new workflow:
"Smart Solutions" (main analysis page)
"Generated Documents" (auto-created solutions)
"Source Library" (reference documents)
"System Overview" (analytics dashboard)
Problem-Type Detection: Automatically determines document types needed based on keywords (culvert, erosion, pollution, etc.)
